Hence, various government agencies have ensured the continuing provision of communication services to their heads and other officials and employees in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities, such as telephone services, voice over internet protocol phones, mobile phones, internet connectivity, and subscription to online telecommunication programs and applications.  With regard to mobile telecommunication services, the departments/agencies in the Executive Branch of the government have implemented differing approaches and modalities to efficiently provide this essential communication service, e.g., procurement via public bidding of institutional/enterprise postpaid accounts from a public telecommunication entity or provider, or on a ""pay-first, reimburse-later"" basis, and the like. Furthermore, the departments/agencies have also adopted varying maximum reimbursable ceilings and/or rates in their respective policies/guidelines on communication expenses.

For this purpose, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) is directed to issue the necessary supplemental guidelines for the effective implementation of said Order.  1.2 While COS and JO workers in the government are paid salaries or wages equivalent to those received by personnel occupying comparable positions in government and a premium of up to 20% of such salary or wage, they do not enjoy the benefits accorded to regular government employees such as Mid-Year and Year-End Bonuses, Performance- Based Bonus, and Personnel Economic Relief Allowance.  For that reason, granting a year-end Gratuity Pay to COS and JO workers is a well-deserved recognition of their hard work and valuable participation in the implementation of various programs, activities, and projects (P/A/Ps), and pivotal role in the delivery of government services amidst the present socio-economic challenges.  <!-- Footnote=""| Authorizing the Grant of Gratuity Pay to Contract of Service and Job Order Workers in Government for Fiscal Year 2023"" -->  <!-- PageNumber=""Page 1 of 6"" -->  # 2.0 Purpose  This Circular is issued to provide the policy and procedural guidelines on the grant of the Gratuity Pay for FY 2023 pursuant to AO No. 13, s. 2023.  3.0 Coverage  This Circular covers all COS and JO workers whose services are directly engaged by departments, bureaus, offices, and agencies of the National Government, including Constitutional Offices enjoying fiscal autonomy, SUCs, GOCCs, and LWDs.   ## 4.0 Exclusions  Institutional COS workers assigned in government agencies are excluded from the coverage of the Circular.

Hence, various government agencies have ensured the continuing provision of communication services to their heads and other officials and employees in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities, such as telephone services, voice over internet protocol phones, mobile phones, internet connectivity, and subscription to online telecommunication programs and applications.  With regard to mobile telecommunication services, the departments/agencies in the Executive Branch of the government have implemented differing approaches and modalities to efficiently provide this essential communication service, e.g., procurement via public bidding of institutional/enterprise postpaid accounts from a public telecommunication entity or provider, or on a ""pay-first, reimburse-later"" basis, and the like. Furthermore, the departments/agencies have also adopted varying maximum reimbursable ceilings and/or rates in their respective policies/guidelines on communication expenses.  To ensure the appropriate, equitable, and prudent use of government funds, there is a need to prescribe the guidelines on the payment of communication expenses of certain government personnel.  <!-- PageNumber=""Page 1 of 10"" -->  2.0 Purpose  This Circular is being issued to provide the guidelines on the payment of communication expenses incurred by authorized officials and employees for the performance of their official duties and responsibilities.  3.0 Scope and Coverage  3.1 This Circular shall cover the communication expenses incurred locally and/or internationally by authorized officials and regular employees of the departments/agencies under the Executive Branch in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities.

The military personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines under the Department of National Defense, as well as the uniformed personnel of the Philippine National Police, Philippine Public Safety College, Bureau of Fire Protection, and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology under the Department of the Interior and Local Government; Bureau of Corrections under the Department of Justice; Philippine Coast Guard under the Department of Transportation; and the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources are likewise encouraged to prescribe and adopt their respective internal policies on the payment of a similar and reasonable amount for communication expenses that could better represent the ranks of personnel, operational requirements, and other working conditions, consistent with existing policies and guidelines.  3.3 In crafting their respective internal policies on the payment of communication expenses, the agencies concerned shall emphasize the need to ensure the judicious and prudent use of government funds and that there is no duplication of similar or related expenses for the purpose, subject to existing budgeting, accounting and auditing laws, rules and regulations.  <!-- Footnote=""1 ""An Act to Promote Financial Viability and Fiscal Discipline in Government-Owned or -Controlled Corporations and to Strengthen the Role of the State in Its Governance and Management to Make Them More Responsive to the Needs of Public Interest and for Other Purposes"""" -->  <!-- PageNumber=""Page 2 of 10"" -->  4.0 Definition of Terms Source: BUDGET-CIRCULAR-NO-2024-2-DATED-AUGUST-2-2024.md Content: # BUDGET CIRCULAR  <figure>  ![](figures/0)  <!-- FigureContent=""BUDGET AND \*\*\* DEPARTM 1936"" -->  </figure>   <figure>  ![](figures/1)  <!-- FigureContent=""OFFICIAL"" -->  </figure>   REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT GENERAL SOLANO STREET, SAN MIGUEL, MANILA ===   ## BUDGET CIRCULAR  No. 2024 - 1  Date: April 4, 2024  ||| | - | - | | TO .. | Heads of Departments, Bureaus, Offices, and Agencies of the National Government, Including Constitutional Offices Enjoying Fiscal Autonomy; State Universities and Colleges (SUCs); Government-Owned or -Controlled Corporations (GOCCs), Chief Executives of Local Government Units (LGUs); and All Others Concerned | | SUBJECT : | Updated Rules and Regulations on the Grant of the Uniform/Clothing Allowance (U/CA) to Civilian Government Personnel |   ## 1.0 Background  Section 58 of the General Provisions of Republic Act (RA) No. 11975 or the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 General Appropriations Act (GAA) authorizes the payment of the U/CA not exceeding Seven Thousand Pesos (₱7,000) per annum for each qualified government employee, subject to the guidelines, rules, and regulations issued by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).   ## 2.0 Purpose  This Circular is issued to prescribe the updated rules and regulations on the grant of the U/CA to civilian personnel.   ### 3.0 Coverage  These Circular covers civilian government personnel occupying regular, contractual, or casual positions; appointive or elective; rendering services on full-time or part-time basis.  <!-- PageNumber=""Page 1 of 8"" -->  ## 4.0 Exclusions  The following are excluded from the coverage of this Circular:  4.1 Military personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines under the Department of National Defense and the uniformed personnel of the Philippine National Police, Philippine Public Safety College, Bureau of Fire Protection, and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology under the Department of the Interior and Local Government, Philippine Coast Guard under the Department of Transportation, Bureau of Corrections under the Department of Justice, and the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.  4.2 Foreign service personnel of the Department of Foreign Affairs and of other departments/agencies who are stationed abroad;  4.3 Barangay officials and employees paid monthly honoraria; and  4.4 Those hired without employer-employee relationships and funded from non-Personnel Services appropriations/budgets, as follows:  4.4.1 Consultants and experts hired for a limited period to perform specific activities or services with expected outputs;  4.4.2 Laborers hired through job contracts (pakyaw) and those paid on piecework bases;  4.4.3 Student laborers and apprentices; and  4.4.4 Those whose services are engaged through job orders, contracts of service, and others similarly situated.   ### 5.0 Rationale of the Grant of U/CA  The U/CA is granted to defray expenses for uniforms or distinctive clothing which are the required appropriate attire for employees in the regular performance of their work.

With regard to mobile telecommunication services, the departments/agencies in the Executive Branch of the government have implemented differing approaches and modalities to efficiently provide this essential communication service, e.g., procurement via public bidding of institutional/enterprise postpaid accounts from a public telecommunication entity or provider, or on a ""pay-first, reimburse-later"" basis, and the like. Furthermore, the departments/agencies have also adopted varying maximum reimbursable ceilings and/or rates in their respective policies/guidelines on communication expenses.
