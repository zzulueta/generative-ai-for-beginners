      "Subsequently, we counted the number of sightings in each year. We used two methods to carry out these calculations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Method 1: Use the value_counts() function to tally the instances of each year, sort them in descending order, and pick the top 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "top_10_years_with_most_sightings = data['year'].value_counts().nlargest(10)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Method 2: Group the dataframe by 'year' and count the number of sightings using the size() function. After that, sort the results in descending order and pick the top 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
