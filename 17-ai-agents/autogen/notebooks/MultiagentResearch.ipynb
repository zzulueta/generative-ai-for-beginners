Our system features a streamlined yet functionally robust interface,\\nallowing for the articulation of editing operations (e.g., inserting elements,\\nerasing objects, altering color) with minimal input. These interactions are\\nmonitored by a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to anticipate editing\\nintentions in real time, bypassing the need for explicit prompt entry. Finally,\\nwe apply a powerful diffusion prior, enhanced by a carefully learned two-branch\\nplug-in module, to process editing requests with precise control. Experimental\\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of MagicQuill in achieving high-quality\\nimage edits.

Is this\\nactually true? We investigate this question and find that the features and\\nrepresentations learned during pre-training are not essential. Surprisingly,\\nusing only the attention patterns from pre-training (i.e., guiding how\\ninformation flows between tokens) is sufficient for models to learn high\\nquality features from scratch and achieve comparable downstream performance. We\\nshow this by introducing a simple method called attention transfer, where only\\nthe attention patterns from a pre-trained teacher ViT are transferred to a\\nstudent, either by copying or distilling the attention maps. Since attention\\ntransfer lets the student learn its own features, ensembling it with a\\nfine-tuned teacher also further improves accuracy on ImageNet. We\\nsystematically study various aspects of our findings on the sufficiency of\\nattention maps, including distribution shift settings where they underperform\\nfine-tuning. We hope our exploration provides a better understanding of what\\npre-training accomplishes and leads to a useful alternative to the standard\\npractice of fine-tuning\\n\\n\\nPaper 3: Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth\\n  Magnets\\nAbstract:   Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological\\nproperties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear.\\nHere, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental\\nband crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating\\ncandidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state\\ncharacteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2\\nchiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states.\\nOur results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi\\narcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with\\nphotoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate\\nmaterials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance\\nour understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic\\nsymmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.\\n\\n\\nPaper 4: A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double\\nAbstract:   One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to\\nuse non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve\\nthis goal with the quantum double model $\\\\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific\\nnon-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a\\nqubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for\\ncreating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design\\na specialized anyon interferometer to measure the total charge remotely for\\nwell-separated anyons; this avoids fusing them together. These protocols enable\\nthe implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active\\nquantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation\\nprocess. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we\\nencode each physical degree of freedom of $\\\\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel,\\nquantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the\\nlogical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal\\noffers a promising path to realize universal topological quantum computation in\\nthe NISQ era.\\n\\n\\nPaper 5: A Bayesian Optimization Approach to Machine Translation Reranking\\nAbstract:   Reranking a list of candidates from a machine translation system with an\\nexternal scoring model and returning the highest-scoring candidate remains a\\nsimple and effective method for improving the overall output quality.\\nTranslation scoring models continue to grow in size, with the best models being\\ncomparable to generation models. Thus, reranking can add substantial\\ncomputational cost to the translation pipeline. In this work, we pose reranking\\nas a Bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) problem. By strategically selecting\\ncandidates to score based on a balance of exploration and exploitation, we show\\nthat it is possible to find top-scoring candidates when scoring only a fraction\\nof the candidate list. For instance, our method achieves the same CometKiwi\\nscore using only 70 scoring evaluations compared a baseline system using 180.\\nWe present a multi-fidelity setting for BayesOpt, where the candidates are\\nfirst scored with a cheaper but noisier proxy scoring model, which further\\nimproves the cost-performance tradeoff when using smaller but well-trained\\ndistilled proxy scorers.\\n\\n\\nPaper 6: CropCraft: Inverse Procedural Modeling for 3D Reconstruction of Crop\\n  Plants\\nAbstract:   The ability to automatically build 3D digital twins of plants from images has\\ncountless applications in agriculture, environmental science, robotics, and\\nother fields. However, current 3D reconstruction methods fail to recover\\ncomplete shapes of plants due to heavy occlusion and complex geometries. In\\nthis work, we present a novel method for 3D reconstruction of agricultural\\ncrops based on optimizing a parametric model of plant morphology via inverse\\nprocedural modeling. Our method first estimates depth maps by fitting a neural\\nradiance field and then employs Bayesian optimization to estimate plant\\nmorphological parameters that result in consistent depth renderings. The\\nresulting 3D model is complete and biologically plausible. We validate our\\nmethod on a dataset of real images of agricultural fields, and demonstrate that\\nthe reconstructions can be used for a variety of monitoring and simulation\\napplications.\\n\\n\\nPaper 7: Reggeization in Color\\nAbstract:   In the high energy limit, $s\\\\gg -t$, amplitudes in planar gauge theories\\nReggeize, with power law behavior $\\\\big( \\\\frac{s}{-t} \\\\big)^{\\\\alpha(t)}$\\ngoverned by the Regge trajectory $\\\\alpha(t)$. Beyond the planar limit this\\nsimplicity is violated by \"Regge cuts\", for which practical organizational\\nprinciples are still being developed. We use a top-down effective field theory\\norganization based on color projection in the $t$ channel and rapidity\\nevolution equations for collinear impact factors, to sum large $s\\\\gg -t$\\nlogarithms for Regge cut contributions. The results are matrix equations which\\nare closed within a given color channel. To illustrate the method we derive in\\nQCD with $SU(N_c)$ for the first time a closed 6$\\\\times$6 evolution equation\\nfor the \"decupletons\" in the $\\\\text{10}\\\\oplus\\\\overline{\\\\text{10}}$ Regge color\\nchannel, a 2$\\\\times$2 evolution equation for the \"triantapentons\" in the\\n$\\\\text{35}\\\\oplus\\\\overline{\\\\text{35}}$ color channel, and a scalar evolution\\nequation for the \"tetrahexaconton\" in the 64 color channel. More broadly, our\\napproach allows us to describe generic Reggeization phenomena in non-planar\\ngauge theories, providing valuable data for the all loop structure of\\namplitudes beyond the planar limit.\\n\\n\\nPaper 8: Advancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding with Multi-Scale Alignment\\n  in Multi-Modal Models\\nAbstract:   Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in\\nfine-grained visual understanding across a range of tasks. However, they often\\nencounter significant challenges due to inadequate alignment for fine-grained\\nknowledge, which restricts their ability to accurately capture local details\\nand attain a comprehensive global perception. While recent advancements have\\nfocused on aligning object expressions with grounding information, they\\ntypically lack explicit integration of object images, which contain affluent\\ninformation beyond mere texts or coordinates. To bridge this gap, we introduce\\na novel fine-grained visual knowledge alignment method that effectively aligns\\nand integrates multi-scale knowledge of objects, including texts, coordinates,\\nand images. This innovative method is underpinned by our multi-scale\\nfine-grained enhancement data synthesis pipeline, which provides over 300K\\nessential training data to enhance alignment and improve overall performance.\\nFurthermore, we present TinyGroundingGPT, a series of compact models optimized\\nfor high-level alignments. With a scale of approximately 3B parameters,\\nTinyGroundingGPT achieves outstanding results in grounding tasks while\\ndelivering performance comparable to larger MLLMs in complex visual scenarios.\\n\\n\\nPaper 9: A study on late time UV-emission in core collapse supernovae and the\\n  implications for the peculiar transient AT2018cow\\nAbstract:   Over time, core-collapse supernova (CCSN) spectra become redder due to dust\\nformation and cooling of the SN ejecta. A UV detection of a CCSN at late times\\nthus indicates an additional physical process such as interaction between the\\nSN ejecta and the circumstellar material, or viewing down to the central engine\\nof the explosion. Both these models have been proposed to explain the peculiar\\ntransient AT2018cow, a luminous fast blue optical transient that has been\\ndetected in the UV 2-4 years after the event with only marginal fading over\\nthis time period. To identify if the late-time UV detection of AT2018cow could\\nindicate that it is a CCSN, we investigate if CCSNe are detected in the UV\\nbetween 2-5 years after the explosion. We use a sample of 51 nearby (z<0.065)\\nCCSNe observed with the Hubble Space Telescope within 2-5 years of discovery.\\nWe measure their brightness, or determine an upper limit on the emission\\nthrough an artificial star experiment if there is no detection. For two CCSNe\\nwe detect a point source within the uncertainty region of the SN position. Both\\nhave a low chance alignment probability with bright objects within their host\\ngalaxies and are thus likely related to the SNe. Comparing the absolute UV\\nmagnitude of AT2018cow to the absolute UV magnitudes of the two potential SN\\ndetections, there is no evidence that a late-time UV detection of AT2018cow is\\natypical for interacting SNe. However, when limiting to CCSNe closer than\\nAT2018cow, we see that it is brighter than the upper limits on most\\nnon-detections. Combined with a very small late time photospheric radius of\\nAT2018cow, this leads us to conclude that AT2018cow\\'s late-time UV detection\\nwas not driven by interaction. It suggests instead that we are possibly viewing\\nthe inner region of the explosion. Such properties are naturally expected in\\ntidal disruption models and are less straightforward in supernova scenarios.\\n\\n\\nPaper 10: LLM Hallucination Reasoning with Zero-shot Knowledge Test\\nAbstract:   LLM hallucination, where LLMs occasionally generate unfaithful text, poses\\nsignificant challenges for their practical applications. Most existing\\ndetection methods rely on external knowledge, LLM fine-tuning, or\\nhallucination-labeled datasets, and they do not distinguish between different\\ntypes of hallucinations, which are crucial for improving detection performance.\\nWe introduce a new task, Hallucination Reasoning, which classifies\\nLLM-generated text into one of three categories: aligned, misaligned, and\\nfabricated. Our novel zero-shot method assesses whether LLM has enough\\nknowledge about a given prompt and text. Our experiments conducted on new\\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in hallucination reasoning\\nand underscore its importance for enhancing detection performance.\\n\\n\\nPaper 11: Squeezed Attention: Accelerating Long Context Length LLM Inference\\nAbstract:   Emerging Large Language Model (LLM) applications require long input prompts\\nto perform complex downstream tasks like document analysis and code generation.\\nFor these long context length applications, the length of the input prompt\\nposes a significant challenge in terms of inference efficiency since the\\ninference costs increase linearly with sequence length. However, for many of\\nthese applications, much of the context in the prompt is fixed across different\\nuser inputs, thereby providing the opportunity to perform offline optimizations\\nto process user inputs quickly, as they are received. In this work, we propose\\nSqueezed Attention as a mechanism to accelerate LLM applications where a large\\nportion of the input prompt is fixed. We first leverage K-means clustering\\noffline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity\\nand represent each cluster with a single centroid value. During inference, we\\ncompare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which of\\nthe keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant and need to be loaded\\nduring inference. We then compute exact attention using only these important\\nkeys from the fixed context, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational\\ncosts. We also extend our method to use a hierarchical centroid lookup to\\nidentify important keys, which can reduce the complexity of attention from\\nlinear to logarithmic with respect to the context length. We implement\\noptimized Triton kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with\\nimportant keys, achieving more than 4x speedups during both the prefill and\\ngeneration phases for long-context inference. Furthermore, we have extensively\\nevaluated our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench,\\nwhere it achieves a 3x reduction in KV cache budget without accuracy loss and\\nup to an 8x reduction with <0.5 point accuracy gap for various models.\\n\\n\\nPaper 12: Superposition of plane waves in high spatial dimensions: from landscape\\n  complexity to the deepest minimum value\\nAbstract:   In this article, we introduce and analyse some statistical properties of a\\nclass of models of random landscapes of the form ${\\\\cal H}({\\\\bf\\nx})=\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2}{\\\\bf x}^2+\\\\sum_{l=1}^M \\\\phi_l({\\\\bf k}_l\\\\cdot {\\\\bf x}), \\\\, \\\\,\\n{\\\\bf x}\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^N,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mu>0 $ where both the functions $\\\\phi_l(z)$ and\\nvectors ${\\\\bf k}_l$ are random. An important example of such landscape\\ndescribes superposition of $M$ plane waves with random amplitudes, directions\\nof the wavevectors, and phases, further confined by a parabolic potential of\\ncurvature $\\\\mu$.\\n  Our main efforts are directed towards analysing the landscape features in the\\nlimit $N\\\\to \\\\infty, M\\\\to \\\\infty$ keeping $\\\\alpha=M/N$ finite. In such a limit\\nwe find (i) the rates of asymptotic exponential growth with $N$ of the mean\\nnumber of all critical points and of local minima known as the annealed\\ncomplexities and (ii) the expression for the mean value of the deepest\\nlandscape minimum (the ground-state energy). In particular, for the latter we\\nderive the Parisi-like optimisation functional and analyse conditions for the\\noptimiser to reflect various phases for different values of $\\\\mu$ and $\\\\alpha$:\\nreplica-symmetric, one-step and full replica symmetry broken, as well as\\ncriteria for continuous, Gardner and random first order transitions between\\ndifferent phases.\\n\\n\\nPaper 13: Conditional regression for the Nonlinear Single-Variable Model\\nAbstract:   Several statistical models for regression of a function $F$ on $\\\\mathbb{R}^d$\\nwithout the statistical and computational curse of dimensionality exist, for\\nexample by imposing and exploiting geometric assumptions on the distribution of\\nthe data (e.g. that its support is low-dimensional), or strong smoothness\\nassumptions on $F$, or a special structure $F$. Among the latter, compositional\\nmodels assume $F=f\\\\circ g$ with $g$ mapping to $\\\\mathbb{R}^r$ with $r\\\\ll d$,\\nhave been studied, and include classical single- and multi-index models and\\nrecent works on neural networks. While the case where $g$ is linear is rather\\nwell-understood, much less is known when $g$ is nonlinear, and in particular\\nfor which $g$\\'s the curse of dimensionality in estimating $F$, or both $f$ and\\n$g$, may be circumvented. In this paper, we consider a model\\n$F(X):=f(\\\\Pi_\\\\gamma X) $ where $\\\\Pi_\\\\gamma:\\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\to[0,\\\\rm{len}_\\\\gamma]$\\nis the closest-point projection onto the parameter of a regular curve $\\\\gamma:\\n[0,\\\\rm{len}_\\\\gamma]\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^d$ and $f:[0,\\\\rm{len}_\\\\gamma]\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^1$.\\nThe input data $X$ is not low-dimensional, far from $\\\\gamma$, conditioned on\\n$\\\\Pi_\\\\gamma(X)$ being well-defined. The distribution of the data, $\\\\gamma$ and\\n$f$ are unknown. This model is a natural nonlinear generalization of the\\nsingle-index model, which corresponds to $\\\\gamma$ being a line. We propose a\\nnonparametric estimator, based on conditional regression, and show that under\\nsuitable assumptions, the strongest of which being that $f$ is coarsely\\nmonotone, it can achieve the $one$-$dimensional$ optimal min-max rate for\\nnon-parametric regression, up to the level of noise in the observations, and be\\nconstructed in time $\\\\mathcal{O}(d^2n\\\\log n)$. All the constants in the\\nlearning bounds, in the minimal number of samples required for our bounds to\\nhold, and in the computational complexity are at most low-order polynomials in\\n$d$.\\n\\n\\nPaper 14: Open B production at hadron colliders in NNLO+NNLL QCD\\nAbstract:   We report on a calculation of open heavy-flavor production at hadron\\ncolliders which extends to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy the\\nclassic NLO-accurate formalism developed almost 30 years ago under the acronym\\nFONLL. The approach retains the exact heavy-flavor mass dependence at low\\ntransverse momentum, $p_T$, and resums collinear logarithms through\\nnext-to-next-to-leading log (NNLL) at high $p_T$. Provided are predictions for\\n$B$-hadrons as well as $B$-decay products like $J/\\\\Psi$ and muons. The main\\nfeatures of the NNLO+NNLL results are reduced scale dependence and moderate\\nNNLO correction, consistent with perturbative convergence in a wide range of\\nkinematic scales from few GeV up to asymptotically large values of $p_T$. The\\nnew calculation significantly improves the agreement with data for $B$-hadrons\\nand muons. We uncover an intriguing discrepancy in $J/\\\\Psi$ final states which\\nmay point to a lower value of the $B\\\\to J/\\\\Psi$ decay rate.\\n\\n\\nPaper 15: Towards a Classification of Open-Source ML Models and Datasets for\\n  Software Engineering\\nAbstract:   Background: Open-Source Pre-Trained Models (PTMs) and datasets provide\\nextensive resources for various Machine Learning (ML) tasks, yet these\\nresources lack a classification tailored to Software Engineering (SE) needs.\\nAims: We apply an SE-oriented classification to PTMs and datasets on a popular\\nopen-source ML repository, Hugging Face (HF), and analyze the evolution of PTMs\\nover time. Method: We conducted a repository mining study. We started with a\\nsystematically gathered database of PTMs and datasets from the HF API. Our\\nselection was refined by analyzing model and dataset cards and metadata, such\\nas tags, and confirming SE relevance using Gemini 1.5 Pro. All analyses are\\nreplicable, with a publicly accessible replication package. Results: The most\\ncommon SE task among PTMs and datasets is code generation, with a primary focus\\non software development and limited attention to software management. Popular\\nPTMs and datasets mainly target software development. Among ML tasks, text\\ngeneration is the most common in SE PTMs and datasets. There has been a marked\\nincrease in PTMs for SE since 2023 Q2. Conclusions: This study underscores the\\nneed for broader task coverage to enhance the integration of ML within SE\\npractices.\\n\\n\\nPaper 16: X-ray reverberation modelling of the continuum, optical/UV time-lags in\\n  quasars\\nAbstract:   Context: Extensive, multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns of nearby and\\nhigher redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have shown that the UV/optical\\nvariations are well correlated with time delays which increase with increasing\\nwavelength. Such behaviour is expected in the context of the X-ray thermal\\nreverberation of the accretion disc in AGN. Aims: Our main objective is to use\\ntime-lag measurements of luminous AGN and fit them with sophisticated X-ray\\nreverberation time-lags models. In this way we can investigate whether X-ray\\nreverberation can indeed explain the observed continuum time lags, and whether\\ntime-lag measurements can be used to measure physical parameters such as the\\nX-ray corona height and the spin of the black hole (BH) in these systems.\\nMethods: We use archival time-lag measurements for quasars from different\\nsurveys, and we compute their rest frame, mean time-lags spectrum. We fit the\\ndata with analytical X-ray reverberation models, using $\\\\chi^2$ statistics, and\\nfitting for both maximal and non spinning BHs, for various colour correction\\nvalues and X-ray corona heights. Results: We found that X-ray reverberation can\\nexplain very well the observed time lags, assuming the measured BH mass,\\naccretion rate and X-ray luminosity of the quasars in the sample. The model\\nagrees well with the data both for non-rotating and maximally rotating BHs, as\\nlong as the corona height is larger than $\\\\sim 40$ gravitational radii. This is\\nin agreement with previous results which showed that X-ray reverberation can\\nalso explain the disc radius in micro-lensed quasars, for the same corona\\nheights. The corona height we measure depends on the model assumption of a\\nperfectly flat disc. More realistic disc models may result in lower heights for\\nthe X-ray corona.\\n\\n\\nPaper 17: Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming\\n  the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion\\nAbstract:   The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum\\nmany-body systems, typically accessed via Greens-functions, is a long-standing\\nproblem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral\\ndecomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the\\nNyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\\\\Delta\\\\omega$\\naccording to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\\\\Delta\\\\omega\\n= 2/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially\\nhard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency\\nresolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional\\nsystems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this\\nfundamental limitation can be overcome using complex-time Krylov spaces. At the\\nexample of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the\\ntwo-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous\\nimprovements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.\\n\\n\\nPaper 18: NeuralDEM -- Real-time Simulation of Industrial Particulate Flows\\nAbstract:   Advancements in computing power have made it possible to numerically simulate\\nlarge-scale fluid-mechanical and/or particulate systems, many of which are\\nintegral to core industrial processes. Among the different numerical methods\\navailable, the discrete element method (DEM) provides one of the most accurate\\nrepresentations of a wide range of physical systems involving granular and\\ndiscontinuous materials. Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted\\napproach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and\\npowder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based\\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical\\nprocesses taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds. However, DEM is\\ncomputationally intensive because of the intrinsic multiscale nature of\\nparticulate systems, restricting simulation duration or number of particles.\\nTowards this end, NeuralDEM presents an end-to-end approach to replace slow\\nnumerical DEM routines with fast, adaptable deep learning surrogates. NeuralDEM\\nis capable of picturing long-term transport processes across different regimes\\nusing macroscopic observables without any reference to microscopic model\\nparameters. First, NeuralDEM treats the Lagrangian discretization of DEM as an\\nunderlying continuous field, while simultaneously modeling macroscopic behavior\\ndirectly as additional auxiliary fields. Second, NeuralDEM introduces\\nmulti-branch neural operators scalable to real-time modeling of\\nindustrially-sized scenarios - from slow and pseudo-steady to fast and\\ntransient. Such scenarios have previously posed insurmountable challenges for\\ndeep learning models. Notably, NeuralDEM faithfully models coupled CFD-DEM\\nfluidized bed reactors of 160k CFD cells and 500k DEM particles for\\ntrajectories of 28s. NeuralDEM will open many new doors to advanced engineering\\nand much faster process cycles.\\n\\n\\nPaper 19: FANSIC: a Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit for the readout of large\\n  silicon photomultipliers\\nAbstract:   Silicon photo-multipliers (SiPM) have been replacing traditional\\nphotomultiplier tubes in most light sensing applications. However, when large\\ndetection surface coverage is needed, photomultipliers (PMTs) are still the\\npreferred choice. The main reasons are the sensor thermal noise and the\\nduration of the fast component of its signal, both increasing with the sensor\\nsurface. In this work we propose an application specific integrated circuit\\n(ASIC), called Fast ANalog SiPM Integrated Circuit (FANSIC), for the readout of\\nlarge SiPMs addressing these limitations. The ASIC has an active summation\\nstage, which allows to divide a large detection surface into smaller ones\\noffering faster response both in single ended and differential outputs. The\\nhigh input bandwidth allows to reach full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) signals or\\nthe order of 3--5 ns which limits the impact of internal and external\\nuncorrelated noise. The results of the first implementation of FANSIC, designed\\nin CMOS 65 nm technology, is described in this paper.\\n\\n\\nPaper 20: Cohomological VC-density: Bounds and Applications\\nAbstract:   The concept of Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) density is pivotal across various\\nmathematical fields, including model theory, discrete geometry, and probability\\ntheory. In this paper, we introduce a topological generalization of VC-density.\\nLet $Y$ be a topological space and\\n$\\\\mathcal{X},\\\\mathcal{Z}^{(0)},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathcal{Z}^{(q-1)}$ be families of\\nsubspaces of $Y$. We define a two parameter family of numbers,\\n$\\\\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\\\\mathcal{X},\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{Z}}}$, which we refer to as\\nthe degree $p$, order $q$, VC-density of the pair \\\\[\\n(\\\\mathcal{X},\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{Z}} =\\n(\\\\mathcal{Z}^{(0)},\\\\ldots,\\\\mathcal{Z}^{(q-1)}). \\\\] The classical notion of\\nVC-density within this topological framework can be recovered by setting $p=0,\\nq=1$. For $p=0, q > 0$, we recover Shelah\\'s notion of higher-order VC-density\\nfor $q$-dependent families. Our definition introduces a new notion when $p>0$.\\nOur main result establishes that that in any model of these theories \\\\[\\n\\\\mathrm{vcd}^{p,q}_{\\\\mathcal{X},\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{Z}}} \\\\leq (p+q) \\\\dim X. \\\\]\\nThis result generalizes known VC-density bounds in these structures, extending\\nthem in multiple ways, as well as providing a uniform proof paradigm applicable\\nto all of them. We give examples to show that our bounds are optimal. We\\npresent combinatorial applications of our higher-degree VC-density bounds,\\nderiving topological analogs of well-known results such as the existence of\\n$\\\\varepsilon$-nets and the fractional Helly theorem. We show that with certain\\nrestrictions, these results extend to our higher-degree topological setting.\\n\\n', 'name': 'Executor', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': 'Thank you for providing the abstracts.
