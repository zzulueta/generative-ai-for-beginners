This relation has been studied\\nfor decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant\\ngalaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central\\nblack holes in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only\\nprovides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a\\nBayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\\\bullet-\\\\sigma$ relation across 244\\ngalaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting\\na central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting\\nprobability with a linear regression of mass on $\\\\sigma$. From the logistic\\nregression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of $11$, $34$ and\\n$126$ km/s have a $50$%, $90$% and $99$% probability of hosting a central black\\nhole, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the\\nmodel, we find that $M_\\\\bullet \\\\propto \\\\sigma^{5.8}$, which is significantly\\nsteeper than the slope reported in earlier studies. Our model also predicts a\\npopulation of under-massive black holes ($M_\\\\bullet=10-10^5 M_\\\\odot$) in\\ngalaxies with $\\\\sigma \\\\lesssim 127$ km/s and over-massive black holes\\n($M_\\\\bullet \\\\geq 1.8 \\\\times 10^7$) above this threshold. This reveals an\\nunexpected abundance of galaxies with intermediate-mass and ultramassive black\\nholes, accessible to next-generation telescopes like the Extremely Large\\nTelescope.\\n\\n\\nPaper 2: UTMath: Math Evaluation with Unit Test via Reasoning-to-Coding Thoughts\\nAbstract:   The evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities is essential for\\nadvancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) have shown impressive performance in solving mathematical problems,\\nexisting benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH present limitations, including\\nnarrow problem definitions with specific numbers and reliance on predetermined\\nrules that hinder accurate assessments of reasoning and adaptability. This\\npaper introduces the UTMath Benchmark, which robustly evaluates the models\\nthrough extensive unit tests. It consists of 1,053 problems across 9\\nmathematical domains, with over 68 test cases per problem.We propose an\\ninnovative evaluation framework inspired by unit testing in software\\ndevelopment, focusing on both accuracy and reliability of results. Furthermore,\\nwe introduce the Reasoning-to-Coding of Thoughts (RCoT) approach, which\\nencourages LLMs to perform explicit reasoning before generating code, leading\\nto generating more advanced solution and improved performance. Furthermore, we\\nare releasing not only the UTMath benchmark but also the UTMath-Train training\\ndataset (more than 70k samples), to support the community in further exploring\\nmathematical reasoning.\\n\\n\\nPaper 3: OpenThaiGPT 1.5: A Thai-Centric Open Source Large Language Model\\nAbstract:   OpenThaiGPT 1.5 is an advanced Thai language chat model based on Qwen v2.5,\\nfinetuned on over 2,000,000 Thai instruction pairs. This report provides an\\nengineering perspective on the model\\'s development, capabilities, and\\nperformance. We discuss the model\\'s architecture, training process, and key\\nfeatures, including multi-turn conversation support, Retrieval Augmented\\nGeneration (RAG) compatibility, and tool-calling functionality. Benchmark\\nresults demonstrate OpenThaiGPT 1.5\\'s state-of-the-art performance on various\\nThai language tasks, outperforming other open-source Thai language models. We\\nalso address practical considerations such as GPU memory requirements and\\ndeployment strategies.\\n\\n\\nPaper 4: DeepONet as a Multi-Operator Extrapolation Model: Distributed\\n  Pretraining with Physics-Informed Fine-Tuning\\nAbstract:   We propose a novel fine-tuning method to achieve multi-operator learning\\nthrough training a distributed neural operator with diverse function data and\\nthen zero-shot fine-tuning the neural network using physics-informed losses for\\ndownstream tasks. Operator learning effectively approximates solution operators\\nfor PDEs and various PDE-related problems, yet it often struggles to generalize\\nto new tasks. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning a pretrained model,\\nwhile carefully selecting an initialization that enables rapid adaptation to\\nnew tasks with minimal data. Our approach combines distributed learning to\\nintegrate data from various operators in pre-training, while physics-informed\\nmethods enable zero-shot fine-tuning, minimizing the reliance on downstream\\ndata. We investigate standard fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning,\\napplying both to train complex nonlinear target operators that are difficult to\\nlearn only using random initialization. Through comprehensive numerical\\nexamples, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach, showcasing significant\\nimprovements in accuracy. Our findings provide a robust framework for advancing\\nmulti-operator learning and highlight the potential of transfer learning\\ntechniques in this domain.\\n\\n\\nPaper 5: Contextualized Evaluations: Taking the Guesswork Out of Language Model\\n  Evaluations\\nAbstract:   Language model users often issue queries that lack specification, where the\\ncontext under which a query was issued -- such as the user\\'s identity, the\\nquery\\'s intent, and the criteria for a response to be useful -- is not\\nexplicit. For instance, a good response to a subjective query like \"What book\\nshould I read next?\" would depend on the user\\'s preferences, and a good\\nresponse to an open-ended query like \"How do antibiotics work against\\nbacteria?\" would depend on the user\\'s expertise. This makes evaluation of\\nresponses to such queries an ill-posed task, as evaluators may make arbitrary\\njudgments about the response quality. To remedy this, we present contextualized\\nevaluations, a protocol that synthetically constructs context surrounding an\\nunderspecified query and provides it during evaluation. We find that the\\npresence of context can 1) alter conclusions drawn from evaluation, even\\nflipping win rates between model pairs, 2) nudge evaluators to make fewer\\njudgments based on surface-level criteria, like style, and 3) provide new\\ninsights about model behavior across diverse contexts. Specifically, our\\nprocedure uncovers an implicit bias towards WEIRD contexts in models\\' \"default\"\\nresponses and we find that models are not equally sensitive to following\\ndifferent contexts, even when they are provided in prompts.\\n\\n\\nPaper 6: Score-based generative diffusion with \"active\" correlated noise sources\\nAbstract:   Diffusion models exhibit robust generative properties by approximating the\\nunderlying distribution of a dataset and synthesizing data by sampling from the\\napproximated distribution. In this work, we explore how the generative\\nperformance may be be modulated if noise sources with temporal correlations --\\nakin to those used in the field of active matter -- are used for the\\ndestruction of the data in the forward process. Our numerical and analytical\\nexperiments suggest that the corresponding reverse process may exhibit improved\\ngenerative properties.\\n\\n\\nPaper 7: Add-it: Training-Free Object Insertion in Images With Pretrained\\n  Diffusion Models\\nAbstract:   Adding Object into images based on text instructions is a challenging task in\\nsemantic image editing, requiring a balance between preserving the original\\nscene and seamlessly integrating the new object in a fitting location. Despite\\nextensive efforts, existing models often struggle with this balance,\\nparticularly with finding a natural location for adding an object in complex\\nscenes. We introduce Add-it, a training-free approach that extends diffusion\\nmodels\\' attention mechanisms to incorporate information from three key sources:\\nthe scene image, the text prompt, and the generated image itself. Our weighted\\nextended-attention mechanism maintains structural consistency and fine details\\nwhile ensuring natural object placement. Without task-specific fine-tuning,\\nAdd-it achieves state-of-the-art results on both real and generated image\\ninsertion benchmarks, including our newly constructed \"Additing Affordance\\nBenchmark\" for evaluating object placement plausibility, outperforming\\nsupervised methods. Human evaluations show that Add-it is preferred in over 80%\\nof cases, and it also demonstrates improvements in various automated metrics.\\n\\n\\nPaper 8: Watermark Anything with Localized Messages\\nAbstract:   Image watermarking methods are not tailored to handle small watermarked\\nareas. This restricts applications in real-world scenarios where parts of the\\nimage may come from different sources or have been edited. We introduce a\\ndeep-learning model for localized image watermarking, dubbed the Watermark\\nAnything Model (WAM). The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image,\\nwhile the extractor segments the received image into watermarked and\\nnon-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from the\\nareas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolution\\nand without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and\\nmultiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the\\nart methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against\\ninpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers\\nnew capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and\\nextract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small\\nregions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small $256\\\\times\\n256$ images.\\n\\n\\nPaper 9: Learning from Limited and Imperfect Data\\nAbstract:   The datasets used for Deep Neural Network training (e.g., ImageNet, MSCOCO,\\netc.) are often manually balanced across categories (classes) to facilitate\\nlearning of all the categories. This curation process is often expensive and\\nrequires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across\\nclasses. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet,\\netc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often\\nover-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for\\nwell-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect\\ndatasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models\\nto be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing\\nrobust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is\\nnecessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural\\nNetworks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real\\nworld. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of\\nlearning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on\\nLearning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the\\nmode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image\\ngenerations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective\\ngeneralization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which\\nallow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit\\ngeneration of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing\\nRelevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed\\ndata with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part,\\nwhich focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various\\ndomains with zero to very few labeled samples.\\n\\n\\nPaper 10: Tooling or Not Tooling? The Impact of Tools on Language Agents for\\n  Chemistry Problem Solving\\nAbstract:   To enhance large language models (LLMs) for chemistry problem solving,\\nseveral LLM-based agents augmented with tools have been proposed, such as\\nChemCrow and Coscientist. However, their evaluations are narrow in scope,\\nleaving a large gap in understanding the benefits of tools across diverse\\nchemistry tasks. To bridge this gap, we develop ChemAgent, an enhanced\\nchemistry agent over ChemCrow, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its\\nperformance on both specialized chemistry tasks and general chemistry\\nquestions. Surprisingly, ChemAgent does not consistently outperform its base\\nLLMs without tools. Our error analysis with a chemistry expert suggests that:\\nFor specialized chemistry tasks, such as synthesis prediction, we should\\naugment agents with specialized tools; however, for general chemistry questions\\nlike those in exams, agents\\' ability to reason correctly with chemistry\\nknowledge matters more, and tool augmentation does not always help.\\n\\n\\nPaper 11: Modeling of non-planar slicer for improved surface quality in material\\n  extrusion 3D printing\\nAbstract:   This paper introduces an algorithm to generate a 3D extruder path, combining\\nclassic planar and non-planar layers to enhance the surface quality and\\naccuracy of complex 3D printed parts. Material extrusion 3D printing, due to\\nits layer-by-layer construction method, produces parts with a discretization\\neffect commonly referred to as the \"staircase\" effect, particularly on\\nnear-flat surfaces. The algorithm addresses this issue using a mixed-layer\\napproach that uses 3D non-planar layers for the surfaces that would benefit\\nfrom non-planar printing, and planar layers for the remaining regions. Existing\\nstudies have demonstrated similar combined layer methods but are often limited\\nin the variety and complexity of shapes they can process due to their inherent\\nslicing techniques. This algorithm presents a universal approach to non-planar\\nextruder path generation by identifying the non-planar surfaces and generating\\nnon-planar extruder paths that conform to the object\\'s surface. Subsequently,\\nit identifies the space occupied by the non-planar layers and removes it from\\nthe original mesh to produce a collision-free planar-only mesh, sliced using\\nclassic planar methods. The algorithm was evaluated on objects of various\\ncomplex shapes, comparing the results with outputs from standard planar\\nslicers. The improvement in surface accuracy was also quantified by measuring\\nthe Chamfer Distance. Specifically, it is shown that the algorithm can generate\\nnon-planar extruder paths of complex geometries, improving surface quality.\\n\\n\\nPaper 12: TempCharBERT: Keystroke Dynamics for Continuous Access Control Based on\\n  Pre-trained Language Models\\nAbstract:   With the widespread of digital environments, reliable authentication and\\ncontinuous access control has become crucial. It can minimize cyber attacks and\\nprevent frauds, specially those associated with identity theft. A particular\\ninterest lies on keystroke dynamics (KD), which refers to the task of\\nrecognizing individuals\\' identity based on their unique typing style. In this\\nwork, we propose the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to recognize\\nsuch patterns. Although PLMs have shown high performance on multiple NLP\\nbenchmarks, the use of these models on specific tasks requires customization.\\nBERT and RoBERTa, for instance, rely on subword tokenization, and they cannot\\nbe directly applied to KD, which requires temporal-character information to\\nrecognize users. Recent character-aware PLMs are able to process both subwords\\nand character-level information and can be an alternative solution.\\nNotwithstanding, they are still not suitable to be directly fine-tuned for KD\\nas they are not optimized to account for user\\'s temporal typing information\\n(e.g., hold time and flight time). To overcome this limitation, we propose\\nTempCharBERT, an architecture that incorporates temporal-character information\\nin the embedding layer of CharBERT. This allows modeling keystroke dynamics for\\nthe purpose of user identification and authentication. Our results show a\\nsignificant improvement with this customization. We also showed the feasibility\\nof training TempCharBERT on a federated learning settings in order to foster\\ndata privacy.\\n\\n\\nPaper 13: Grounding Video Models to Actions through Goal Conditioned Exploration\\nAbstract:   Large video models, pretrained on massive amounts of Internet video, provide\\na rich source of physical knowledge about the dynamics and motions of objects\\nand tasks. However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an\\nagent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states\\ndepicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate\\nvision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map\\nimage states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often\\nexpensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar\\nto the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to\\ndirectly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in\\nthe embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for\\nexploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action\\ngeneration in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve\\ncomplex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels,\\nor segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero,\\n6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual\\nNavigation. We show how our approach is on par with or even surpasses multiple\\nbehavior cloning baselines trained on expert demonstrations while without\\nrequiring any action annotations.\\n\\n\\nPaper 14: Gravitational production of massive vectors non-minimally coupled to\\n  gravity\\nAbstract:   A quantum theory of massive Abelian vector bosons with non-minimal couplings\\nto gravity has been studied within an evolving, isotropic, and homogeneous\\ngravitational background. The vectors may play a role of dark matter if\\nstabilizing $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed. In order to construct a gauge\\ninvariant theory of massive vectors that couple to the Ricci scalar and Ricci\\ntensor, a generalization of the Stuckelberg mechanism has been invoked.\\nConstraints that ensure consistency of the model had been formulated and\\ncorresponding restrictions upon the space of non-minimal couplings have been\\nfound. Canonical quantization of the theory in evolving gravitational\\nbackground was adopted. Mode equations for longitudinally and\\ntransversally-polarized vector bosons were derived and solved numerically.\\nRegions of exponential growth in the solutions of the mode equations have been\\ndetermined and discussed in detail. The spectral energy density for the three\\npolarizations has been calculated, and the UV divergence of the integrated\\ntotal energy density has been addressed. Finally, assuming their stability, the\\npresent abundance of the vector bosons has also been calculated.\\n\\n\\nPaper 15: Self-separated and self-connected models for mediator and outcome\\n  missingness in mediation analysis\\nAbstract:   Missing data is a common problem that challenges the study of effects of\\ntreatments. In the context of mediation analysis, this paper addresses\\nmissingness in the two key variables, mediator and outcome, focusing on\\nidentification. We consider self-separated missingness models where\\nidentification is achieved by conditional independence assumptions only and\\nself-connected missingness models where identification relies on so-called\\nshadow variables. The first class is somewhat limited as it is constrained by\\nthe need to remove a certain number of connections from the model. The second\\nclass turns out to include substantial variation in the position of the shadow\\nvariable in the causal structure (vis-a-vis the mediator and outcome) and the\\ncorresponding implications for the model. In constructing the models, to\\nimprove plausibility, we pay close attention to allowing, where possible,\\ndependencies due to unobserved causes of the missingness. In this exploration,\\nwe develop theory where needed. This results in templates for identification in\\nthis mediation setting, generally useful identification techniques, and perhaps\\nmost significantly, synthesis and substantial expansion of shadow variable\\ntheory.\\n\\n\\nPaper 16: wilson: A package for renormalization group running in the SMEFT with\\n  Sterile Neutrinos\\nAbstract:   Sterile neutrinos are well-motivated beyond the Standard Model (BSM)\\nparticles. The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) augmented with\\nthese new fields is known as the $\\\\nu$SMEFT. We present the first code for\\nsolving the renormalization group equations (RGEs) of the $\\\\nu$SMEFT in an\\nautomated way. For this purpose, we have implemented the $\\\\nu$SMEFT as a new\\neffective field theory (EFT) in the Wilson coefficient exchange format WCxf.\\nFurthermore, we included anomalous dimensions depending on the gauge couplings\\nand Yukawas in the python package wilson. This novel version of wilson allows a\\nconsistent inclusion of $\\\\nu$SMEFT renormalization group (RG) running effects\\nabove the electroweak (EW) scale in phenomenological studies involving sterile\\nneutrinos. Moreover, this new release allows us to study EW, strong, and Yukawa\\nrunning effects separately within the SMEFT.\\n\\n\\nPaper 17: TreeCoders: Trees of Transformers\\nAbstract:   In this paper, we introduce TreeCoders, a novel family of transformer trees.\\nWe moved away from traditional linear transformers to complete k-ary trees.\\nTransformer blocks serve as nodes, and generic classifiers learn to select the\\nbest child and route the sequence of tokens to a specific leaf. The selectors,\\nmoved outside the transformer blocks, allow for the use of a variety of\\narchitecture without further modifications. Furthermore, our proposed\\narchitecture supports sparse node activation due to the logarithmic complexity\\nof a tree search. We validate our idea by testing a series of decoder-only tree\\ntransformers, achieving competitive results across a diverse range of language\\ndatasets. Our study demonstrates that the proposed tree transformer model\\noutperforms a size-equivalent linear transformer model 76\\\\% of the time over a\\nwide range of tree architectures. Furthermore, our proposed model naturally\\nlends itself to distributed implementation.\\n\\n\\nPaper 18: Multifunctional spintronic transistors: Sub-60 mV/dec switching,\\n  non-local GMR, and NDR in spin gapless semiconductor and/or spin gapped metal\\n  FETs\\nAbstract:   Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for\\nspintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics.\\nThis study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic\\nfield-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as\\nsource and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to\\nmetal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms\\nbetween the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike\\ntraditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique\\nspin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60\\nmV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs\\nfor low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative\\ndifferential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current\\nratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local\\ngiant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications\\nlike logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support\\ncomputing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data\\nprocessing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for\\nthese multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to\\nidentify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for\\nsimulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green\\'s function method with density\\nfunctional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\\\\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\\\\mathrm{G}}$) and\\noutput ($I_{\\\\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\\\\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a\\nVS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a\\nsub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable\\nnon-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance\\napplications.\\n\\n\\nPaper 19: Semantic Logical Relations for Timed Message-Passing Protocols (Extended\\n  Version)\\nAbstract:   Many of today\\'s message-passing systems not only require messages to be\\nexchanged in a certain order but also to happen at a certain \\\\emph{time} or\\nwithin a certain \\\\emph{time window}. Such correctness conditions are\\nparticularly prominent in Internet of Things (IoT) and real-time systems\\napplications, which interface with hardware devices that come with inherent\\ntiming constraints. Verifying compliance of such systems with the intended\\n\\\\emph{timed protocol} is challenged by their \\\\emph{heterogeneity} -- ruling out\\nany verification method that relies on the system to be implemented in one\\ncommon language, let alone in a high-level and typed programming language. To\\naddress this challenge, this paper contributes a \\\\emph{logical relation} to\\nverify that its inhabitants (the applications and hardware devices to be proved\\ncorrect) comply with the given timed protocol. To cater to the systems\\'\\nheterogeneity, the logical relation is entirely \\\\emph{semantic}, lifting the\\nrequirement that its inhabitants are syntactically well-typed. A semantic\\napproach enables two modes of use of the logical relation for program\\nverification: (i) \\\\emph{once-and-for-all} verification of an \\\\emph{arbitrary}\\nwell-typed application, given a type system, and (ii) \\\\emph{per-instance}\\nverification of a specific application / hardware device (a.k.a. foreign code).\\nTo facilitate mode (i), the paper develops a refinement type system for\\nexpressing timed message-passing protocols and proves that any well-typed\\nprogram inhabits the logical relation (fundamental theorem). A type checker for\\nthe refinement type system has been implemented in Rust, using an SMT solver to\\ncheck satisfiability of timing constraints. Then, the paper demonstrates both\\nmodes of use based on a small case study of a smart home system for monitoring\\nair quality, consisting of a controller application and various environment\\nsensors.\\n\\n\\nPaper 20: Comparing Bottom-Up and Top-Down Steering Approaches on In-Context\\n  Learning Tasks\\nAbstract:   A key objective of interpretability research on large language models (LLMs)\\nis to develop methods for robustly steering models toward desired behaviors. To\\nthis end, two distinct approaches to interpretability -- ``bottom-up\" and\\n``top-down\" -- have been presented, but there has been little quantitative\\ncomparison between them. We present a case study comparing the effectiveness of\\nrepresentative vector steering methods from each branch: function vectors (FV;\\narXiv:2310.15213), as a bottom-up method, and in-context vectors (ICV;\\narXiv:2311.06668) as a top-down method. While both aim to capture compact\\nrepresentations of broad in-context learning tasks, we find they are effective\\nonly on specific types of tasks: ICVs outperform FVs in behavioral shifting,\\nwhereas FVs excel in tasks requiring more precision. We discuss the\\nimplications for future evaluations of steering methods and for further\\nresearch into top-down and bottom-up steering given these findings.\\n\\n', 'name': 'Executor', 'role': 'user'}, {'content': '### Plan\\n\\n1. **Engineer**: Write a Python script to fetch the 20 latest papers on AI specifically related to Large Language Models from arXiv.\\n2. **Engineer**: Print the abstracts of the fetched papers for categorization.\\n3. **Scientist**: Manually categorize each fetched paper based on the subject discussed in the article into the categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Fine Tuning, Prompt Engineering, and Agents.\\n4. **Engineer**: Write a Python script to count the number of papers in each category and rank them.\\n5. **Writer**: Write a summary of the final output, including the categories and the ranked list.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Execution\\n\\n1. **Engineer**: The script to fetch and print abstracts of the latest 20 papers on Large Language Models has been executed.\\n\\n2. **Scientist**: Manually categorize the papers based on the abstracts.\\n\\nLet\\'s proceed with Step 3 where the Scientist will manually categorize the papers based on their abstracts into the provided categories.\\n\\n### Categorization of Papers\\n1. **Paper 3 - OpenThaiGPT 1.5: A Thai-Centric Open Source Large Language Model**\\n   - Category: Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n\\n2. **Paper 4 - DeepONet as a Multi-Operator Extrapolation Model: Distributed Pretraining with Physics-Informed Fine-Tuning**\\n   - Category: Fine Tuning\\n\\n3. **Paper 5 - Contextualized Evaluations: Taking the Guesswork Out of Language Model Evaluations**\\n   - Category: Prompt Engineering\\n\\n4. **Paper 7 - Add-it: Training-Free Object Insertion in Images With Pretrained Diffusion Models**\\n   - Category: Agents\\n\\n5. **Paper 8 - Watermark Anything with Localized Messages**\\n   - Category: Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n\\n6. **Paper 9 - Learning from Limited and Imperfect Data**\\n   - Category: Fine Tuning\\n\\n7. **Paper 10 - Tooling or Not Tooling?
